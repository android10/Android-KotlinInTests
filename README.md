Android-KotlinInTests
=========================

This is a sample app that is part of blog posts I have written about how to test android applications using Kotlin.

[Android Testing with Kotlin](http://fernandocejas.com/2017/02/03/android-testing-with-kotlin/)


## Local Development

Here are some useful Gradle/adb commands for executing this example:

 * `./gradlew clean build` - Build the entire example and execute unit and integration tests plus lint check.
 * `./gradlew runUnitTests` - Execute both unit and integration tests.
 * `./gradlew runAcceptanceTests` - Execute espresso and instrumentation acceptance tests.
